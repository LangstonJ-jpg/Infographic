                <h1>What does the public perception look like?</h1>
                <p>A small survey was conducted, and it was determined that the public has an incorrect perception of schizophrenia.
                    The participants were prompted with the question of "Do people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities?" and were given a choice of True or False.
                    The results of the survey were organized and presented in the corresponding chart.

                   <h1>Understanding Schizophrenia</h1>
    <p>
        Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. 
        It is often misunderstood and stigmatized, but it is a treatable condition with the right support and care.
    </p>
    <p>
        Common symptoms include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hallucinations:</strong> Hearing or seeing things that aren't there.</li>
            <li><strong>Delusions:</strong> Strong beliefs that are not based on reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Disorganized Thinking:</strong> Difficulty organizing thoughts or speech.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Withdrawal:</strong> Reduced ability to express emotions or connect with others.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Schizophrenia is believed to result from a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. 
        Early diagnosis and treatment, including therapy and medication, can help individuals manage symptoms and 
        lead fulfilling lives.

                <h1>Understanding Dissociative Identity Disorder</h1>
                <p>
                    Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder, It 
                    is a complex psychological condition characterized by the presence of two or more distinct 
                    identities or personality states within a single individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common symptoms include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Memory Gaps:</strong> Difficulty recalling everyday events, personal information, or traumatic experiences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Distinct Identities:</strong> Each identity may have its own name, age, gender, and behaviors.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dissociation:</strong> Feeling detached from oneself or the environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emotional Distress:</strong> Anxiety, depression, or other mood-related symptoms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    DID is often associated with severe trauma, particularly during early childhood, such as abuse or neglect. 
                    Treatment typically involves psychotherapy to integrate the identities and address the underlying trauma.

                    Many of the misconceptions surrounding schizophrenia are merely products of misinformation that arise due to a lack of education 
                    regarding the condition and its effects.
